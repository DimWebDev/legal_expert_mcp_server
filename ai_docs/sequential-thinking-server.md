# Sequential Thinking Server

**Source:** https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/blob/main/src/sequentialthinking/index.ts

This is the TypeScript implementation of the Sequential Thinking Server from the Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers repository. This server provides a specialized tool for dynamic and reflective problem-solving through sequential thoughts.

 description: `A detailed tool for dynamic and reflective problem-solving through sequential thoughts.

KEY FEATURES:
â€¢ Chain of Thought Reasoning: Express complex reasoning as a series of connected thoughts
â€¢ Revision Support: Revise and improve previous thoughts when needed
â€¢ Progress Tracking: Track your reasoning progress with numbered thoughts and completion status
â€¢ Branching Logic: Create thought branches for exploring alternative approaches
â€¢ Self-Assessment: Evaluate whether more thoughts are needed to reach a conclusion

USAGE:
Send thoughts as JSON with these required fields:
â€¢ thought: The actual thought content (string)
â€¢ thoughtNumber: Sequential number for this thought (number)  
â€¢ totalThoughts: Estimated total thoughts needed (number, can be adjusted)
â€¢ nextThoughtNeeded: Whether more thoughts are coming (boolean)

Optional fields:
â€¢ isRevision: Mark this as a revision of a previous thought (boolean)
â€¢ revisesThought: Which thought number this revises (number)
â€¢ branchFromThought: Branch off from this thought number (number) 
â€¢ branchId: Unique identifier for the branch (string)
â€¢ needsMoreThoughts: Flag if more thoughts are needed for completion (boolean)

EXAMPLES:

Basic sequential thinking:
{
  "thought": "I need to analyze the problem systematically by breaking it down into components",
  "thoughtNumber": 1,
  "totalThoughts": 3,
  "nextThoughtNeeded": true
}

Revising a previous thought:
{
  "thought": "Actually, I should consider the edge cases more carefully in my analysis",
  "thoughtNumber": 2,
  "totalThoughts": 4,
  "isRevision": true,
  "revisesThought": 1,
  "nextThoughtNeeded": true
}

Creating a branch:
{
  "thought": "Let me explore an alternative approach to this problem",
  "thoughtNumber": 1,
  "totalThoughts": 2,
  "branchFromThought": 2,
  "branchId": "alternative_approach",
  "nextThoughtNeeded": true
}

Final thought:
{
  "thought": "Based on my analysis, the best solution is X because of reasons Y and Z",
  "thoughtNumber": 4,
  "totalThoughts": 4,
  "nextThoughtNeeded": false
}

BENEFITS:
â€¢ Structured reasoning process
â€¢ Ability to backtrack and revise
â€¢ Clear progress indicators  
â€¢ Support for complex, branching analysis
â€¢ Visual feedback on thought progression
â€¢ Self-correcting reasoning capability

Use this tool when you need to work through complex problems step-by-step, want to show your reasoning process clearly, or need to explore multiple solution paths systematically.`,

## Key Components

### ThoughtData Interface
Defines the structure for individual thoughts with support for:
- Basic sequential thoughts
- Revisions of previous thoughts
- Branching logic for alternative approaches
- Progress tracking

### SequentialThinkingServer Class
Manages the thought processing with features:
- Thought history tracking
- Branch management
- JSON validation
- Rich console formatting with colors
- Optional logging control

### Tool Definition
Comprehensive tool specification with:
- Detailed usage examples
- All parameter descriptions
- Benefits and use cases
- Input schema validation

## Environment Variables
- `DISABLE_THOUGHT_LOGGING`: Set to "true" to disable console logging

This server enables structured, step-by-step reasoning with the ability to revise thoughts and explore alternative approaches through branching logic.
